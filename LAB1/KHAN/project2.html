        <p>
            The beef flavours the sauce. For this recipe, you’ll sear the Italian meatballs before transferring them out of the pan. Then, using the juices left behind, you’ll create the flavourful and rich tomato sauce with garlic, onion, bay leaves, and crushed tomatoes. The result is an amazing and flavourful tomato sauce to smother your meatballs in.
And the sauce flavours the beef. Once you’ve created the sauce, the meatballs return to the pan to simmer, allowing the naturally occurring msg in the tomatoes to bring out the umami flavour in the beef. The result is beefy, saucy goodness all around.
Meatballs are more versatile than you think. When you make them, serve them with your favourite pasta. The next day, reheat some leftover Italian meatballs in tomato sauce to have on their own or in a meatball sandwich. After that, mix them into a meat sauce. The options are endless!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a shallow plate, whisk together Panko breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside.
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add beaten eggs into another shallow plate.
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Dip both sides of each halved chicken breast into the eggs to evenly coat them, and then dip it into the breadcrumb mixture. The breadcrumbs will stick to the egg wash.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Prepare the meatballs. In a large mixing bowl, combine beef with breadcrumbs, milk, egg, garlic, parsley, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Mix well and form the mixture into a uniform consistency. Take 2 spoonfuls of the beef mixture at a time and roll them into meatballs. Set aside.
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cook the meatballs. Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet or shallow saucepan over medium-high heat for 2 minutes until the hot oil sizzles. Slowly add the meatballs and gently stir to cook until browned on all sides, about 6 to 8 minutes. Make sure to stir gently to prevent meatballs from disintegrating. Transfer the meatballs to a plate and set aside (Note that the meatballs are not fully cooked at this point). 
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make the tomato sauce. In the same skillet, add onion and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper.
